            <li>1/2 cup pasta cooking water, or as needed</li>

            <li>1/2 onion, diced or 1 large shallot, diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

            <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vodka</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>Step 1:</h3>

        <p>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and
            cook according to package instructions until just al dente, about 9
            minutes. Scoop out 1/2 cup pasta water and set aside. Drain pasta.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2:</h3>

        <p>
            Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat
            and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add
            garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomato
            paste and cook, stirring, until tomato paste starts to darken and is
            well combined with the onion, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3:</h3>

        <p>
            Pour in heavy cream and vodka and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes
            until alcohol evaporates. Stir in red pepper flakes and cook,
            stirring, until well combined. Season with salt and pepper.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4:</h3>

        <p>
            Stir in butter until melted. Add drained pasta and 1/4 cup pasta
            water. Add more pasta water depending on how thick you like the
            sauce. Stir in freshly grated Parmesan cheese, taste, and adjust
            seasoning with salt and pepper. Continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes
            over low heat until well combined.
