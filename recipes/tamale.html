            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>Step 1:</h3>

        <p>
            Cut pork into 3 chunks and place in a large saucepan. Add onion,
            garlic, bay leaves, and salt and cover with water. Bring to a boil;
            skim foam from surface. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 1 hour.
            Remove pork and let cool. Strain broth and reserve.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2:</h3>

        <p>
            Bring a pot of water to a boil while pork is cooking. Add tomatoes,
            arbol chiles, and guajillo chiles, and boil until chiles are soft,
            about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, reserving cooking
            water, and allow to cool.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3:</h3>

        <p>
            Place corn husks in a bowl, cover with boiling water, and soak for
            30 to 60 minutes. Drain, place on a work surface, and cover with a
            clean, damp towel.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4:</h3>

        <p>
            Combine tomatoes, 1/2 cup cooking water, chiles de arbol, guajillo
            chiles, and cornstarch in a blender; blend until smooth. Strain
            tomato sauce through a fine-mesh sieve.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 5:</h3>

        <p>
            Beat lard with an electric mixer in a large bowl until fluffy.
            Combine masa, 1 cup reserved pork broth, 1 tablespoon salt, and
            baking powder in a separate bowl and mix until smooth. Add masa
            mixture to lard and mix until it has a smooth cookie dough
            consistency. Test if the masa is ready by dropping a small ball of
            masa into a glass of cold water; if it floats, it's ready, if not,
            keep beating for a little longer.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 6:</h3>

        <p>Shred cooled pork with 2 forks.</p>

        <h3>Step 7:</h3>

        <p>
            Select 1 wide corn husk or 2 small ones. Spread about 2 tablespoons
            masa mixture onto the the corn husk, filling it up to 2 inches from
            the bottom and 1/4 inch from the top. Add 1 tablespoon of the tomato
            sauce and pork down the center of the masa mixture. Fold sides of
            husk together, 1 over the other. Fold the bottom of the husk over
            the seam of the 2 folded sides. Repeat with remaining husks.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 8:</h3>

        <p>
            Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just
            below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add tamales
            with the open side up and cook until filling is heated through and
            separates from the husk, about 1 hour. Let tamales rest for 15
            minutes before serving.
